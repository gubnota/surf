<p>A stolen Picasso painting that had been missing for more than 10 years has been found in the US after it was posted to <a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">New York</a> in a parcel marked “Happy Christmas”.</p>
<p>The package, labelled as “art craft/toy” with a value described as $37 (£24), arrived in Newark from Belgium in a FedEx shipment just before Christmas, marked <em>Joyeux Noël</em>.</p>
<p>But when American customs officers examined it, they found a Picasso cubist masterwork worth at least $2.5m. The 1911 painting, <em>La Coiffeuse</em> (The Hairdresser), had been registered missing from a storeroom at the <a class=" u-underline" href="https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link">Centre Georges Pompidou</a> in Paris in 2001.</p>
<p>The US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Loretta Lynch, has filed a civil suit to return the painting to <a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/france" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">France</a>.</p>
<p>On 17 December, someone named “Robert” with an address in Belgium shipped the oil painting, which measured 33cm by 46cm, to a climate-controlled warehouse in Long Island City. The next day, the painting arrived at the Port of Newark and was seized. The identity of the person to whom it was sent has not been released.</p>
<p>The painting, which belongs to the French national collection, was last shown in Munich in 1998. It was then placed in storage at the Pompidou centre in <a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/paris" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Paris</a> but staff realised it was missing when a loan request was made by another museum in 2001.</p>

<p>The Bristolian street artist Banksy has returned to Palestine to create another series of works, following his famous <a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.theguardian.com/arts/pictures/0,,1543331,00.html" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link">2005 series painted on the West Bank barrier</a> wall.</p>
<figure class="element element-image img--landscape fig--no-caption" data-media-id="68adaf4ea6972fd4c132bb2c5ec4ead4fbce29d0"><img class="gu-image" src="http://i.guim.co.uk/static/w-620/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/26/1424954841648/aa3f5cb5-85dd-4281-8b51-f342744e04e4-620x372.jpeg" alt="Banksy Gaza" width="620" /></figure>
<p>The works, which he trailed on his <a class=" u-underline" href="https://instagram.com/banksy/" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link">Instagram</a> account last night, include one piece which somewhat resembles Rodin’s sculpture <a class=" u-underline" href="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/24/1366824172174/Rodins-The-Thinker-010.jpg" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link">The Thinker</a>, with the figure’s hand gone from thoughtfully supporting his face to covering it in despair – or perhaps Niobe, the classical figure weeping for the loss of her children. Another features a kitten sprayed on the remains of a wall, posed playing with a coiled ball of rusted metal as if it were wool. A third features children swinging around a watchtower as though it were a fairground ride.</p>
<figure class="element element-image img--landscape fig--no-caption" data-media-id="b658f519538de38ea7ef7890f1f4e57c5408d537"><img class="gu-image" src="http://i.guim.co.uk/static/w-620/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/26/1424954880473/f5e31e9b-7aaf-4755-8410-530d2b0fe15c-620x372.jpeg" alt="Gaza Banksy" width="620" /></figure>
<p>The artist made a film to go alongside the works, documenting the devastation wrought by Israeli militia and bombing campaigns. “Make this the year YOU discover a new destination,” he sarcastically writes in its captions, recalling the banal exhortations of holiday brochures. One local is recorded saying of the kitten painting: “This cat tells the whole world that she is missing joy in her life. The cat found something to play with. What about our children?” The camera then rests on text that reads: “If we wash our hands of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless we side with the powerful – we don’t remain neutral.”</p>

<p>The artist’s previous work in Gaza on the barrier wall that seals off the <a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/palestinian-territories" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Palestinian territories</a> from Israel included an image depicting a group of girls being lifted aloft my balloons. The now infamous image marked the moment where the artist widened his satire from social problems in the UK to international issues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Royal family are rather used to sitting for portraits but the Duke of Cambridge might be a tad surprised by the latest recreation of his and his son&#8217;s likeness.</p>
<p>The piece was created by food artist Michelle Wibowo from Michelle Sugar Art, using a staggering 16,074 individual triangles of Toblerone.<span id="more-330"></span></p>

<h6>This portrait marks the Duke of Cambridge&#8217;s first Father&#8217;s Day as a Dad, made using 16,074 individual Toblerone chocolate triangles and taking more than 100 hours to make</h6>
<p>It took more than 1,500 bars of the iconic shaped chocolate bar using dark, milk and white chunks to create depth and dimension.</p>
<p>The art work measures an enormous 12ft x 8ft and weights a staggering 154kg.</p>
<p>The full creation took Michelle more than 100 hours of planning, preparation and construction.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;When I was asked to create a portrait of Prince William and Baby George, I was very excited.<br />
&#8216;It has taken me a long time to map out the exact location for each tiny piece of chocolate to create a recognizable image, but the hardest process was trying not to eat the Toblerone along the way.&#8217;<img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/13/article-2657078-1EB11C7F00000578-670_634x420.jpg" alt="The portrait was made using a whopping 16,074 individual Toblerone chocolate triangles" /></p>
<h6>The portrait was made using a whopping 16,074 individual Toblerone chocolate triangles</h6>
<p>Michelle, 36, studied at the National Baking School in London after completing an architecture degree in Indonesia, where she was born.</p>
<p>She says she draws on her architectural training in determining her attention to detail and sophistication in her creations.</p>
<p>Her life-sized life-like cake depicting a baby was exhibited at London&#8217;s Victoria & Albert Museum in 2011, and she&#8217;s won numerous awards including gold at the Culinary Olympics.</p>
<p>Her creations are exhibited around the world and she also teaches internationally.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Chicago artist has come up with a novel way of fixing the city&#8217;s pothole problem by turning them into mosaic works of art.</p>
<blockquote><p>He also leaves a fake serial number on the mosaic</p></blockquote>
<p>Jim Bachor has transformed the holes in the road starting within his own neighbourhood in Mayfair by not only filling them in but making them a work of art.</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s a way to say, “This is a Chicago pothole!”</p></blockquote>

<p>He also leaves a fake serial number on the mosaic as a humorous way of pointing out the severity of the pothole problem in the city.<br />
The artist told <strong>Hyperallegenic.com</strong>: &#8220;It&#8217;s a way to say, “This is a Chicago pothole!”&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;The fake serial numbers are a joke, a comment on the number of potholes there actually are in Chicago,&#8217; Mr Bachor added.</p>

<h6>Mr Bachor says that mosaics are one of the few artistic techniques that survive</h6>
<p>Mr Bachor uses the same materials for all his mosaics, roughly costing $50 and tries to keep them all the same size.<br />
According to his website, he says he creates the mosaics that &#8216;speak of modern things but in an ancient voice&#8217;.<br />
Mr Bachor added: &#8216;It’s hard to make your mark in this world. Mosaics are one of the few techniques that can really survive.&#8217;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are multiple reasons for selling masterpieces – making money undoubtedly being one of them. In the case of Marina Picasso, granddaughter of Pablo, the motive appears to be a type of revenge.</p>
<p>Revenge on her grandfather, who mostly ignored her during his lifetime and let her grow up in near-poverty.</p>
<p>In a book in 2001, Picasso: My Grandfather, Marina said that the artist had no interest in children and “drove everyone who got near him to despair”.</p>
<p>Ms Picasso, 64, has let it be known this week that she is willing to accept offers privately for up to seven of her grandfather’s works worth an estimated £200m. She also wants to sell the artist’s famous villa near Cannes, La Californie.<span id="more-310"></span></p>
<p>When she sold two Picasso paintings last year, Marina announced that she would make other sales. “For once, I’m doing something with my grandfather, even if he is no longer with us,” she said. “This sale is a way of making him take part in my life’s work.”</p>
<p>Marina Picasso’s “life’s work” is to support poor or orphaned children, notably in Vietnam. Most of the proceeds from last year’s sales went to her children’s association, the Marina Picasso Foundation. By getting rid of part of her Picasso collection – she is thought to have around 400 paintings and 7,000 sketches – Marina is, in effect, forcing the curmudgeonly genius to do something for children 41 years after his death.</p>
<p>Marina Picasso, born in 1950, lives in Geneva, She is the daughter of Paulo, Picasso’s first child from his marriage with the Russian ballet dancer Olga Khokhlova. She has yet to comment on the proposed new sales but she said last year: “I am selling my paintings to give myself a reason to exist… I spent part of my own childhood in great poverty. For many years, I couldn’t look at my grandfather’s work because, to me, they represented immense suffering.” The future sales were revealed this week by an unnamed “friend” of Marina Picasso, talking to the New York Post. She has decided to sell privately, apparently because she was disappointed with the £5m proceeds of two paintings that she sold at Sotheby’s Paris last year.</p>
<p>The seven works now on sale are said to include the 1923 portrait of Marina’s mother, Olga Khokhlova, which is valued at around £40m. The others includes a 1921 painting called Maternité (£35m), and a relatively early work, before the development of the characteristic Picasso cubist style, Femme à la Mandoline (£40m).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article9960866.ece/alternates/w620/marina_picasso_afp.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></p>
<p>Is money the motivation? Partly, says John Lichfield, but so is revenge</p>
<p>There will also be great interest in Picasso’s house La Californie, where he spent his final years with Jacqueline Roque, mother of two of his four children. Marina Picasso owns the house as part of her share of the vast and complex Picasso inheritance.</p>
<p>The painter left no will but a court settlement in 1974 ordered his paintings and property to be divided between his four children, legitimate and illegitimate. Marina has turned the Cannes villa into a Picasso museum in recent years and exhibited part of her collection of her grandfather’s works there last summer.</p>
<p>In her 2001 book, she said that La Californie holds mostly sad memories for her. Jacqueline Roque restricted visits to the elderly Picasso and subjected her and her brother, Pablito, to “long waits behind the gate”.</p>
<p>She told Agence France Presse last year: “Living in this house, unconsciously perhaps, it’s a way of recapturing lost time in a place where we were once excluded. Jacqueline used to order that we wait; she rejected anything that disturbed Picasso.”</p>
<p>Soon after Picasso’s death, her brother Pablito committed suicide, after Jacqueline Roque refused to allow him to attend his grandfather’s funeral. For Marina, selling Picasso and Roque’s home, is also, perhaps, a form of revenge.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before drawing art portraits you should first consider some basics. Particularly important when drawing a face are the proportions. Of course everyone is different, but many basic proportions are always approximately equal and there are typical mistakes that a beginner often commits.</p>
<p>For example, the height of the forehead and the position of the eyes. Often the forehead is drawn intuitively to a minimum, and the eyes up too far on the face. The eyes are located approximately in the middle of the face. Maybe it&#8217;s the hair that deceives one in their own perception. When I started to draw faces and people, this error often undermined my art portraits.</p>
<p>As a kind of unit when drawing faces the nose can be used. The eyes divide the face in half. The forehead is about two noses high, the mouth + chin are also a nose high.</p>
<p>In the picture below you can see again the broad division of the face in height (coloured markers).</p>
